This is how I added a button to my homepage:
```
<button style="display: block; margin-bottom: 10px;">Button</button>
```
This is just an empty button, but to link it to another page, i did this:
```
<button onclick="window.location.href='{{site.baserul}}/areebaahmed_2025/csse/'">CSSE</button>
  <p> These are some projects I worked on last year during CSSE </p>
  ```
  where href= gives the location the button goes to.

This is how I added an image in my homepage:
```
<img src="images/snowboard.png" alt="Snowboarding">
```
the src is the path to the image, and alt is the caption for it
